```
git clone https://github.com/ldthomas/apg-js2-examples.git examples
cd examples 
npm install
```
**APG Examples:**  
In the package.json are the scripts:
```
"apg-help": "apg -h",
"apg-version": "apg -v",
"apg-strict": "apg --in=./apg/lf-only.bnf --strict",
"apg-errors": "apg -i ./apg/bad-elements.bnf",
"apg-rules": "apg --in=./apg/multiple-rules.bnf",
"apg-attributes": "apg --in=./apg/attr-errors.bnf",
"apg-multi": "apg -i ./apg/first.bnf,./apg/second.bnf -o multi.js",
"apg-multiple": "apg -i ./apg/first.bnf --in=./apg/second.bnf --out=multiple.js"
"apg-conv-api": "node ./apg-conv-api/test-suite $1"
```  
You can run any of these APG tests with npm. For example,<br>
* `npm run apg-version` should return something like<br>
`JavaScript APG 3.0.0, Copyright (C) 2017 Lowell D. Thomas, all rights reserved`
* etc.
